This is the GitHub repository for the CDT-D2AIR group working on the depression text classification NLP problem

# Requirements to run

**Please note** that there are two separate requirements.txt files, required to run different parts of the code.
- **src/requirements.txt** for running the base training, adversarial training and semantic robustness analysis and verification
- **src/xai_verification/requirements_xai_verification.txt** for running the XAI-verification pipeline.

This was necessary due to conflicting tensor flow versions required for training and SHAP analysis.
